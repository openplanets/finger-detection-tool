What is Fingerdet?
-----------------
*Help! I have a million images and I'm sure there are some documents with unwanted fingers on scans, but which are they?*

Checking to identify fingers on scan manually is a very time-consuming and error-prone process. You need a tool to help you: Fingerdet.

Fingerdet is an open source tool which:

* provides decision-making support for finger on scans detection in or across collections
* identifies fingers even independent from file format, scan quality, finger sizes, direction, shape, colour and lighting conditions 
* applies state-of-the art image processing  
* is useful in assembling collections from multiple sources, and identifying corrupted files

What Can Fingerdet Do For Me?
----------------------------
Fingerdet brings the following benefits:

* Automated quality assurance
* Reduced manual effort and error
* Saved time
* Lower costs, e.g. storage, effort
* Open source, standalone tool. Also as Taverna component for easy invocation
* Invariant to format, rotation, scale, translation, illumination, resolution, cropping, warping and distortions
* May be applied to wide range of image collections, not just print images

Examples

There are numerous situations in which you may need to identify images with fingers in collections, for example:
